- Understanding the structure and content of the data.
- Identifying missing values and potential outliers.
- Gaining insights into data distributions and relationships between variables.

### 3.2 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
**Impact:** High  
**Weight:** 8

Cleaning the data by handling missing values, correcting errors, and normalizing features ensures a robust foundation for model development. Effective data preprocessing includes:
- Dealing with missing values through imputation or removal.
- Correcting inconsistencies and errors in the data.
- Standardizing or normalizing features to ensure uniformity.

### 3.3 Feature Engineering
**Impact:** Very High  
**Weight:** 9

Creating new features from raw data can significantly improve model performance. This step involves domain knowledge and creativity. Effective feature engineering can include:
- Generating new features based on domain insights.
- Transforming existing features to enhance model learning.
- Reducing dimensionality through techniques like PCA.

### 3.4 Model Development and Tuning

Selecting appropriate models and fine-tuning hyperparameters are crucial for achieving high performance. This step often distinguishes top competitors. Key activities in this step include:
- Choosing the right algorithms based on the problem type.
- Using grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning.
- Implementing regularization techniques to avoid overfitting.

### 3.5 Model Validation and Cross-Validation
**Impact:** Medium  
**Weight:** 6.5

Proper validation techniques ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Cross-validation helps in assessing the robustness of the model and reduces the risk of overfitting. Best practices include:
- Using k-fold cross-validation to validate model performance.
- Employing stratified sampling to maintain class distribution.
- Evaluating models using multiple metrics to ensure robustness.

### 3.6 Ensemble Methods and Stacking
